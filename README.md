### What it does
Uses a list of thriller titles obtained from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_erotic_thriller_films
and finds the taglines from IMDb for each title. Taglines are written to `./text/taglines.txt`.

Also saves the IMDb film `id` for each title to `./text/ids.csv`. The id is obtained by doing a crude 
search on the title and year.

### Capitalization
Taglines on IMDb are written in inconsistent styles. Some use title case:

> All She Wanted Was A Tasteâ€¦ And She Gave As Good As She Got.

Others use regular English sentence case:

> Love can be cruel but obsession can be murder.

The tool makes an attempt to normalize everything to sentence case (note: this is an inexact
process and will sometimes produce the wrong answer.)

### TODO
* Fix capitalization
